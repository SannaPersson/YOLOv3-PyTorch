# YOLOv3 in PyTorch
A quite minimal implementation of YOLOv3 in PyTorch spanning only around 600 lines of code with support for training and evaluation and complete with helper functions for inference. There is currently pretrained weights for Pascal-VOC with MS COCO coming up. With minimal changes in the model with regards to the output format the original weights can also be loaded seamlessly.
